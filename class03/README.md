03 | 2025-01-21 | **[Slides 03](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-slides-2025/slides03.html)** | **[Word 03](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-slides-2025/slides03w.docx)** | **[Code 03](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-slides-2025/blob/main/slides03.qmd)** | Visit [Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu/), select **Zoom** and **Cloud Recordings**

- The HTML link provides the (RevealJS) version of the slides that I suggest you focus on during class.
- The Word link will let you download the material in the slides as a Word (.docx) document.
    - Some people prefer this to the HTML version for live note-taking.
- The Quarto file link provides the code I used (in [Quarto](https://quarto.org/)) to build the slides. Hit the download button after clicking the link above if you want the `.qmd` file.
- To print RevealJS slides **to pdf**, [follow these instructions](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/presenting.html#print-to-pdf) using Google Chrome as your browser.
- We attempt to record **every** 432 class via Zoom and post the recording to Canvas, but there have occasionally been problems in the past.

## Announcements

1. The problem with CRAN backlog are settled, and if you upgrade the `performance` package to version 0.13.0 as well as any other upgrades for the packages you're using in R, you shouldn't still have a problem using `check_model()`.
     - If you want to see what the Lab 1 Question 2 (model 1) `check_model()` result should look like, here's [an image of it](check_models_lab1.png).
2. [Lab 1](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-2025/lab1.html)  is due tomorrow at noon to Canvas. Make sure you are looking at the version of the instructions posted 2025-01-15, which includes a pair of tips.
3. I tweaked the instructions for [Lab 2](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-2025/lab2.html) on 2025-01-17 and [Lab 3](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-2025/lab3.html) on 2025-01-20, so make sure you look at the current versions as you plan your work on those assignments.
4. The most obvious options for real-time project collaboration seem to be [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) and Posit Cloud. Since Google Colab is free, I feel more comfortable recommending it, at least for this semester.
5. I am compiling a list of errors in the current version of the [432 Class Notes](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-notes/), and will make that available to you soon.
