## Today's Slides

Class | Date | HTML | Word | Quarto .qmd | Recording
:---: | :--------: | :------: | :------: | :------: | :-------------:
02 | 2025-01-16 | **[Slides 02](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-slides-2025/slides02.html)** | **[Word 02](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-slides-2025/slides02w.docx)** | **[Code 02](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-slides-2025/blob/main/slides02.qmd)** | Visit [Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu/), select **Zoom** and **Cloud Recordings**

- The HTML link provides the (RevealJS) version of the slides that I suggest you focus on during class.
- The Word link will let you download the material in the slides as a Word (.docx) document.
    - Some people prefer this to the HTML version for live note-taking.
- The Quarto file link provides the code I used (in [Quarto](https://quarto.org/)) to build the slides. Hit the download button after clicking the link above if you want the `.qmd` file.
- To print RevealJS slides **to pdf**, [follow these instructions](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/presenting.html#print-to-pdf) using Google Chrome as your browser.
- We attempt to record **every** 432 class via Zoom and post the recording to Canvas, but there have occasionally been problems in the past.

## Announcements

1. For [Lab 1](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-2025/lab1.html), in question 1b, I meant to list 15 candidate variables, but accidentally listed `unins` twice, and left out `unemp`. I've now fixed that to corrrectly list both `unins` and `unemp` as candidates. I've also added a couple of **tips** to the [instructions](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-2025/lab1.html) that may be helpful.
2. Results of the little pair of polls on [Campuswire](https://campuswire.com/), where I asked "About how many times have you opened R Studio in 2025?" Thanks very much to those of you who completed it (in either version.)
 
Not at all (that's OK) | 1 to 3 times | More than 3 times | Responses
:--------------------: | :--------------------: | :--------------------: | :--------:
12 (37.5%) | 9 (28.1%) | 11 (34.4%) | 32

3. Some results from the Welcome to 432 Survey are [posted to our Shared Drive](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mpLfZoKDNFJ79hdOyNnpiEs6OxDL-0DWFAf-gUjnJwo/edit?usp=drive_link). Thanks to those of you who completed it on time.
4. TA Office Hours begin on Friday. A complete schedule, with Zoom links, is available on our Shared Google Drive, and as an announcement on [Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu/). Remember that we won't hold any office hours this Monday 2025-01-20, because of the Martin Luther King, Jr. Holiday.

## What should I be working on?

1. [Lab 1](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-2025/lab1.html) is due next Wednesday at noon to [Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu/). To do the Lab, you'll want to have installed/updated all of [the necessary software](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-2025/software.html).
2. Read through the [Syllabus](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-2025/), and familiarize yourself with the other materials on [our website](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-2025/), especially the [Course Notes](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-notes/).
3. The [Project A instructions](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-2025/projA.html) are available, and I would read them soon, so you know what you need to be thinking about.
4. Ideally, you'd also be reading [How to be a modern scientist](https://leanpub.com/modernscientist), which you need to finish by the end of January. It's almost ten years old now, but it still has a lot to offer in a small package.
