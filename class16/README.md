## Today's Excerpt from "[Moving to a World Beyond 'p < 0.05'](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-sources/blob/main/pdf/ASA_2019_A_World_Beyond.pdf)"

from **Don't say "Statistically Significant"**

To move forward to a world beyond "p < 0.05," we must recognize afresh that statistical inference is not—and never has been—equivalent to scientific inference. However, looking to statistical significance for a marker of scientific observations' credibility has created a guise of equivalency. 

Moving beyond "statistical significance" opens researchers to the real significance of statistics, which is "the science of learning from data, and of measuring, controlling, and communicating uncertainty."

In sum, "statistically significant" -- don't say it and don't use it.

There are many Do's. With the don’ts out of the way, we can finally discuss ideas for specific, positive, constructive actions. 

We have a massive list of them in [the seventh section of this editorial](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-sources/blob/main/pdf/ASA_2019_A_World_Beyond.pdf)! In that section, the authors of all the articles in this special issue each provide their
own short set of do's.
