## Announcements

1. To come.
2. Frank Harrell's [Regression Modeling Strategies](https://hbiostat.org/rmsc/) and [Biostatistics for Biomedical Research](https://hbiostat.org/bbr/) books are incredibly useful resources for more on the `rms` and `Hmisc` packages.

## Today in "How To Be A Modern Scientist"

- Jeff Leek on "[How to share data with a statistician](https://github.com/jtleek/datasharing)"
- Shannon Ellis and Jeff Leek's publication (2018) [How to share data for collaboration](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7518408/). *The American Statistician*.

### On Data Sharing...

1. It is really hard to create a serious, research quality data set in almost any scientific discipline.
2. Data should be made available when papers are published. The question with reproducibility isn't "if" anymore, it is "how".
3. The transition toward reproducibility is likely to be rough.
4. Data sharing isn't easy and it isn't cheap.
5. Not knowing how to share data isn't an excuse - to be a modern scientist, this is one of the skills you have to have.
6. The culture of credit hasn't caught up with the culture of science.
