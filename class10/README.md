## Announcements

1. The slides posted for Class 10 are enormous (252 slides), and will be discussed (at least) in classes 10 and 11. My effort there is to try to provide a logistic regression example which "covers" material from many different aspects of regression modeling.
    - Here is [an outline](outline.md) of the material discussed in these slides, which also includes [an index of key statistical topics discussed](outline.md#index-of-r-functions-and-key-statistical-ideas).
    - The **support1000 example**, on our Shared Drive already includes many things from these slides, plus some other material. That example will be finished in time for Class 12.
    - In Classes 8 and 9, we worked through a similarly detailed example, involving logistic regression.
2. On 2025-02-17, I revised the [Slides from Class 10](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-slides-2025/slides10.html) to resolve an issue I'd created by changing the random seeds between creating the slides and publishing them. Most of the slides with text explaining the models have revised coefficients as a result.
    - The only material change from the initially published version is to the `fit3` model (where I switched a variable in, and left one out.)
    - However, many of the text explanations referred to my original results (before I switched random seeds) so I had to correct all of those explanations. This issue (plus a couple of typos I caught) required me to make changes to the text in the following slides: 33, 34, 39-40, 42, 46-48, 55-59, 84-85, 90, 94, 98, 102, 107, 192-193, 199, 218, 220 and 246-250, so you definitely want [the latest version](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-slides-2025/slides10.html).
    - In slide 59 of the correct version, you will see a graph where the x axis runs from 8-11 and the red and blue lines cross between 10 and 11.
3. Frank Harrell's [Regression Modeling Strategies](https://hbiostat.org/rmsc/) and [Biostatistics for Biomedical Research](https://hbiostat.org/bbr/) books are incredibly useful resources for more on the `rms` and `Hmisc` packages.
4. On 2025-02-12, I corrected a typo in [Lab 4](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-2025/lab4.html), which referred to `hbp_lab4`, when I meant `hbp_1`.

## Upcoming Deadlines

1. Those of you who need to [submit a revision of your Project A Plan](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-classes-2025/blob/main/projectA/plan_comments.md#project-plans-for-which-i-need-to-see-a-full-revision-by-monday-2025-02-17-at-9-am), please remember to do so by 9 AM Monday 2025-02-17. Thanks.
2. The [Lab 3](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-2025/lab3.html) Answer Sketch and Grading Rubric will be posted to our Shared Drive as soon as all submissions are in, or at noon on Friday, whichever comes first.
3. [Lab 4](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-2025/lab4.html) is due at noon on Wednesday 2025-02-19.
4. It's never too early to get rolling on your [Project A Portfolio](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-2025/projA.html), or [Lab 6](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-2025/lab6.html).

## Today in "How To Be A Modern Scientist"

### On Scientific Blogging

A blog can be a good place to document the things you are learning or working on. See [Lab 6](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-2025/lab6.html).

The kinds of posts that are most useful for raising your profile in terms of job hunting tend to be posts that:

- Show off your storytelling or communication skills
- Show off your data visualization skills
- Teach people how to do some kind of analysis
- Discuss an important issue that is relevant in industry

## One Last Thing

My birthday is this Friday 2025-02-14, and I will be away from email and Campuswire from Thursday evening to Sunday evening. Yes, it is a cute birthday to have with my last name. Well, as an adult, anyway.
