## Announcements

1. I adjusted [the template for Lab 2](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-data/blob/master/data/432_lab2_template.qmd) on 2025-01-24 to include Question 1, part D. Make sure you include a response to **1d** in your submission to [Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu) due Wednesday 2025-01-29 at noon.
2. We'll discuss the instructions for [Project A](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-2025/projA.html) in some detail today. Specificallly, we'll walk through [How Will We Assess the Project A Plans?](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-classes-2025/blob/main/projectA/rubric_plan.md) which I posted on 2025-01-25. Nothing in that document should come as a surprise if you've closely read the [Project A instructions](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-2025/projA.html).
3. I've added a bonus opportunity on [Campuswire](https://campuswire.com/). It's pinned at the top of the list for now, and doesn't expire until at least Spring Break. Please respond, and give a thumbs up to your colleagues with helpful suggestions.
4. Be sure you finish reading [How to be a Modern Scientist](https://leanpub.com/modernscientist) before Class 7, next Tuesday.
5. Today, we'll start using the `rms` package, and here is a useful [Introduction to the R `rms` package: The Linear Model](https://hbiostat.org/bbr/rmsintro.html) by Frank Harrell.
6. The `support1000` example includes material on the `rms` package for both linear and logistic regression. Remember to find it on our Shared Google Drive.
7. The Course Notes discuss the `rms` package for linear regression and the use of polynomials and splines (all topics for this week) in Chapters [13](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-notes/nonlinearity.html) and [14](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-notes/olsfitting.html), primarily. For logistic rregression, it's mostly chapter [21](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-notes/logistic3.html), although chapter [22](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-notes/effectsize.html) has some very useful material (which applies to all kinds of regression models) on effect sizes.

## Coming Soon

On Thursday, in Class 6, our main focus will be adding non-linear terms (specifically polynomials and restricted cubic splines) to our linear and logistic models. After that, we'll discuss the wise spending of degrees of freedom in making decisions about non-linear terms starting in Class 7, including the Spearman rho-squared plot.
