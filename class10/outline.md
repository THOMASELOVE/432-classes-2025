# An Outline of Slides in 432 Class 10

- Don't forget about the similar [outline for the logistic regression slides from Class 8](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-classes-2025/blob/main/class08/outline.md).
- Don't miss the [index of R functions and key statistical ideas](#index-of-r-functions-and-key-statistical-ideas) covered in these slides, too...
