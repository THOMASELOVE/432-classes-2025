01 | 2025-01-14 | **[Slides 01](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-slides-2025/slides01.html)** | **[Word 01](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-slides-2025/slides01w.docx)** | **[Code 01](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-slides-2025/blob/main/slides01.qmd)** | Visit [Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu/), select **Zoom** and **Cloud Recordings**

- The HTML link provides the (RevealJS) version of the slides that I suggest you focus on during class.
- The Word link will let you download the material in the slides as a Word (.docx) document.
    - Some people prefer this to the HTML version for live note-taking.
- The Quarto file link provides the code I used (in [Quarto](https://quarto.org/)) to build the slides. Hit the download button after clicking the link above if you want the `.qmd` file.
- To print RevealJS slides **to pdf**, [follow these instructions](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/presenting.html#print-to-pdf) using Google Chrome as your browser.
- We attempt to record **every** 432 class via Zoom and post the recording to Canvas, but there have occasionally been problems in the past.

## What Should I Be Working On?

### By Wednesday 2025-01-15 at Noon:

1. Get officially registered (SIS) for the right flavor of the course (PQHS 432, CRSP 432 or MPHP 432) if you're not already.
2. Complete the Welcome to 432 survey at <https://bit.ly/432-2025-welcome-survey>.
    - Thanks to those of you who've already done this.
3. Accept your invitation to [Campuswire](https://campuswire.com/) (see your email or just look at your existing account). There's a poll up there at the moment (closes Wednesday at noon.)

### Before our next class Thursday 2025-01-16 at 1 PM

1. Review the [website](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-2025/) and [Calendar](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-2025/calendar.html), and skim the [Syllabus](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-syllabus-2025/) and [Course Notes](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-notes/).
2. Buy Jeff Leek's [How to be a Modern Scientist](https://leanpub.com/modernscientist) (then read this little book by the end of January - it should take ~ 4 hours.)
3. Get started [installing or updating your R and RStudio](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-2025/software.html) and install the [necessary R Packages](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-2025/software.html#r-packages-to-install) and [data/code from 432-Data](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-data).
4. Get started on [Lab 1](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-2025/lab1.html), which is due when the [Calendar](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-2025/calendar.html) says it is. The "431 Review" Chapters from the [432 Course Notes](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-notes/) should be helpful.

- Switching from R Markdown to Quarto
    - I've gathered resources for helping with this transition [on our Sources page](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-sources).
    - Virtually any code you have written in R Markdown can be run using Quarto instead, by simply switching the file extension from .Rmd to .qmd.
    - It's still worth it to learn about how Quarto works, and why it differs from R Markdown when it does.

    - See the [431 Course Notes](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-book/), as well as the [432 Course Notes](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-notes/). Both will remain online until 2025-06-01.
