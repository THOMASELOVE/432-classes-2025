:---------: | :--: | :-------: | :-------: | :----------------: | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hulu, Apple TV, Amazon | 75 | 2013-2018 | TV-MA | Period Drama, Political Thriller | At the height of the Cold War, married KGB spies pose as Americans in Washington, D.C.

1. I love [The Americans](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2149175) because the show is based on real historical events. The show is so well paced and directed, highly recommended to those looking for a TV series that is both thrilling, but also touches on some common themes that one can relate to (e.g. like having a dysfunctional family and the process that comes from healing those relationships).

### Arcane (mentioned by 4 students) [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11126994/)

Stream? | Episodes | Years | Rating | IMDB Genres | IMDB Description
:---------: | :--: | :-------: | :-------: | :----------------: | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Netflix | 18 | 2021-2024 | TV-14 | Action Epic, Adult Animation | Amid the stark discord of twin cities Piltover and Zaun, two sisters fight on rival sides of a war between magic technologies and clashing convictions.

1. I thought the characters in [Arcane](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11126994/) were complex and interesting, the world-building was good, and the animation was very well done.
2. The French animation studio Fortiche has done an INCREDIBLE job on [Arcane](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11126994/). The Sound Design/Production is also well done, it builds the world, fleshes out the characters, and they created a ton of original songs for the show. Somehow they got artists like Sting and Strommae on board and that's no small feat.
3. [Arcane](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11126994/) is animated, and the artwork + music is outstanding. The plot is a dystopian political drama, with elements of fantasy. It centers community and family relationships with the main characters being sisters that are caught in the middle of the political wars.
4. Excellent character writing and world building in [Arcane](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11126994/), which is especially rare coming from something adapted from a video game IP.

### Better Call Saul [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3032476)

Stream? | Episodes | Years | Rating | IMDB Genres | IMDB Description
:---------: | :--: | :-------: | :-------: | :----------------: | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Netflix | 63 | 2015-2022 | TV-MA | Drug Crime, Epic | The trials and tribulations of criminal lawyer Jimmy McGill in the years leading up to and past his fateful run-in with Walter White and Jesse Pinkman.

1. A lot of people recommend [Breaking Bad](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0903747), which I also really enjoyed, but I loved [Better Call Saul](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3032476) even more. I really enjoyed the character development of Saul and others in the show and generally found it very gripping and hard not to watch the next episode. I would say there are some "slow" parts in the show but I did not find them that disinteresting that I wanted to stop watching.

### Boardwalk Empire [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0979432)

Stream? | Episodes | Years | Rating | IMDB Genres | IMDB Description
:---------: | :--: | :-------: | :-------: | :----------------: | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Max, Hulu | 56 | 2010-2014 | TV-MA | Epic, Gangster | An Atlantic City politician plays both sides of the law by conspiring with gangsters during the Prohibition era.

1. [Boardwalk Empire](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0979432) is about the prohibition era, and very well conducted. I love the Steve Buscemi role, and actually my nickname (that only one person uses) is "Nucki", as the name of the main character was Nucki Thompson.

### Buffy the Vampire Slayer [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118276)

Stream? | Episodes | Years | Rating | IMDB Genres | IMDB Description
:---------: | :--: | :-------: | :-------: | :----------------: | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hulu | 145 | 1997-2003 | TV-14 | Supernatural Fantasy, Teen Drama | A young woman, destined to slay vampires, demons and other infernal creatures, deals with her life fighting evil, with the help of her friends.

1. I love the way [Buffy the Vampire Slayer](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118276) uses supernatural creatures to represent real-life struggles, and I love the ensemble cast. Some of my attachment to this series might be the nostalgia I feel when watching it — I started watching when it first aired, and I can’t think of a series that impacted me more when I was growing up. Others might enjoy it for its strong character development and genre-bending episodes.

### The Chosen [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118276)

Stream? | Episodes | Years | Rating | IMDB Genres | IMDB Description
:---------: | :--: | :-------: | :-------: | :----------------: | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------
YouTube | 36 | 2017- | TV-PG | Historical Epic, Drama | The Chosen is a historical drama based on the life of Jesus and those who knew him. Set against the backdrop of Roman oppression in first-century Israel, the series shares an authentic look at Jesus' revolutionary life and teachings.

1. I like [The Chosen](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118276) because it intends to portray the human aspect of Jesus's life. I believe others may enjoy it because it does not overly emphasize his Divine essence.

### The Clinic [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0383087)

1. [The Clinic](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0383087)'s action goes in the Dublin (Ireland) multi-disciplinary health center. The serial depicts everyday doctors work in different fields (say surgery, drug abuse recovery, women's health etc.).

### Dark Matter [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt19231492)

1. [Dark Matter](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt19231492) is mind-boggling sci-fi and talks about the parallel universe concept.  Anyone who loves Quantum physics will appreciate this series.

### Dune: Prophecy [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10466872)

Max | 7 | 2024- | TV-MA | Action Epic, Adventure, Epic | Two Harkonnen sisters combat forces that threaten the future of humankind and establish the fabled sect that will become known as the Bene Gesserit.

1. [Dune: Prophecy](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10466872) has many layered stories that explore human resilience, politics and power. It is set in a futuristic setting, where all "thinking machines" or technology as we know it, is banned but still used to secretly guide humanity.

1. I like [The Equalizer](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11242246) because it has a lot of action. I think others would like this show because it has a new "villain" in every episode, and each case gets solved in one episode.

### [Friends](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108778)

Stream? | Episodes | Years | Rating | IMDB Genres | IMDB Description
:---------: | :--: | :-------: | :-------: | :----------------: | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. I recommend [Friends](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108778) because not only do I have fun watching it, but I also improve my listening and speaking skills as an international student.

### [Fringe](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108778)

1. I love [Fringe](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108778) because of the incredible blend of science and imagination in the mysteries that unfold with each episode. The show’s central characters have amazing chemistry, both as a group and in their individual relationships, creating emotional connections that grow stronger and more familial with each season. If you’re a fan of The X-Files, you’ll likely enjoy Fringe—it has a similar vibe but is less serious and a lot more fun, making it an engaging and entertaining ride from start to finish.

### [Futurama](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0149460/)

Stream? | Episodes | Years | Rating | IMDB Genres | IMDB Description

1. [Game of Thrones](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0944947/) offers a fantasy world filled with complex characters and intricate storylines. I believe others will also enjoy the show for its exciting story and the unforgettable characters.

Stream? | Episodes | Years | Rating | IMDB Genres | IMDB Description
:---------: | :--: | :-------: | :-------: | :----------------: | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. A big portion of this being my favorite series is nostalgia since I grew up watching it every Tuesday night with my mom and sisters, but it’s a fun fast-paced comedy/drama that is filled with witty dialogue and pop culture references.

### [The Good Place]()

### [Grace and Frankie]()

Stream? | Episodes | Years | Rating | IMDB Genres | IMDB Description
:---------: | :--: | :-------: | :-------: | :----------------: | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Netflix

1. I like this series because of the main characters' shared friendship and respective families, as well as the show's generally dry humor/sarcasm. Even though it's centered around a pair of women in their 70s, the humor and some of the life situations depicted could apply to most young adult to older adult generations.

1. I like this series because it is a horror series that doesn't rely completely on jump scares; it has an interesting plot and a great attention to detail. Others who enjoy horror movies (or those who can tolerate horror if it has a good plot) would enjoy it!

### [How I Met Your Mother]()

1. The challenges and things the four friends in the show do I find to be quite hilarious. I think others in the class that have not previously watched the show would enjoy the humor in it as well. 

### [Inventing Anna]()

1. I like this show because it is a drama based on a true story about a young woman who scams her way to the top of New York's most important and rich. The story is told from the perspective of a journalist who uncovers new clues about the woman in each episode, making it a captivating thriller about financial crime and the social dynamics of "high society."

### [Lost]()

Stream? | Episodes | Years | Rating | IMDB Genres | IMDB Description
:---------: | :--: | :-------: | :-------: | :----------------: | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Netflix | 

1. It's the last great weekly serialized show that people could discuss around the water cooler between episodes. The gradual realization that the writers were mostly making it up as they were going along means you can largely just enjoy it as popcorn entertainment.

### [Matlock (original)]()

Stream? | Episodes | Years | Rating | IMDB Genres | IMDB Description
:---------: | :--: | :-------: | :-------: | :----------------: | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Amazon Prime | 

1. I just watched Matlock during Christmas. I enjoy its clever storytelling and the way it keeps you guessing until the very end. The series combines intriguing legal cases with a touch of humor, making it a timeless and entertaining show. I think others might enjoy it for its charm and the brilliance of Andy Griffith’s performance as the titular lawyer.

### [The Mindy Project]()

1. It’s a hilarious and heartwarming romantic comedy centered around Dr. Mindy Lahiri’s life and career. The series showcases a strong, relatable, and flawed female lead navigating her personal and professional world and the witty humor and quirky characters make it an enjoyable watch. I believe others in the class might enjoy its mix of comedy, romance, and the charming, laugh-out-loud moments throughout.

Stream? | Episodes | Years | Rating | IMDB Genres | IMDB Description
:---------: | :--: | :-------: | :-------: | :----------------: | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [NCIS]()

Stream? | Episodes | Years | Rating | IMDB Genres | IMDB Description
:---------: | :--: | :-------: | :-------: | :----------------: | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Netflix

1. It's a crime solving show, most of the murder victims are military personnel. It's funny and carries a bunch of different plot lines throughout the seasons. I don’t recommend anything after 2020, but the first 14 seasons are pretty good.

### [Northern Exposure]()

Stream? | Episodes | Years | Rating | IMDB Genres | IMDB Description
:---------: | :--: | :-------: | :-------: | :----------------: | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Amazon Prime

1. I don't normally like medical shows but this particular series highlights and humanizes the limits of modern medicine (it's from the 90s) across different cultures/populations. It's a fish-out-of water story about a NY physician working in rural Alaska.

### [Parks and Recreation]()

Stream? | Episodes | Years | Rating | IMDB Genres | IMDB Description
:---------: | :--: | :-------: | :-------: | :----------------: | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [Queer Eye]()

:---------: | :--: | :-------: | :-------: | :----------------: | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [River Monsters]()

Stream? | Episodes | Years | Rating | IMDB Genres | IMDB Description
:---------: | :--: | :-------: | :-------: | :----------------: | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Amazon Prime | 

1. This show appeals to a sense of wonder and adventure, as many of the "legendary" fish he aims to catch have myths associated with them. Then, when he inevitably captures the fish, the show ties together fact and fiction in a fun and informative way.

### [Shrinking]()

Stream? | Episodes | Years | Rating | IMDB Genres | IMDB Description
:---------: | :--: | :-------: | :-------: | :----------------: | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Shrinking is about a psychiatrist who is dealing with his own grief while trying to help his patients. The show explores themes of mental health, personal growth, and the human side of therapy, which I find really insightful and engaging. It's a great blend of humor and emotion, and I’ve found it to be both thought-provoking and entertaining.

Max, Amazon Prime 

1. I loved this show because of how crazy and spooky it is. It follows a quasi-real-world plot and brings elements of supernatural realism. It is fairly dark, but Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson knock it out of the park.

### [The White Lotus]()
