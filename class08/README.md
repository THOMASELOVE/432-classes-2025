## Announcements

1. Today's slides are enormous, and will be discussed (at least) in classes 8 and 9. My effort there is to try to provide a logistic regression example which "covers" material from many different aspects of regression modeling. I am working on a similar example for classes 10 and 11, involving linear regression.
2. Today's data comes from the [favorite movies data gathered in 431 this past Fall and in prior years](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-classes-2024/tree/main/movies). The version on our 432-data page is an Excel file, [downloadable here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-data/raw/refs/heads/master/data/movies_2025-01-28.xlsx).
3. Frank Harrell's [Regression Modeling Strategies](https://hbiostat.org/rmsc/) and [Biostatistics for Biomedical Research](https://hbiostat.org/bbr/) books are incredibly useful resources for more on the `rms` and `Hmisc` packages.


## Today in "How To Be A Modern Scientist"

### On Publishing...

Here are some (I hope useful but perhaps controversial) quotes:

1. There is now very little reason to wait (a long time) for your paper to appear in print.
2. Preprints allow you to collect feedback on your work and improve it quickly.
3. Preprints give junior scientists and other researchers gratification that helps them handle the stress and pressure of their first publications.
4. Share your work on social media.
5. In terms of career advancement, preprints are almost entirely valueless until they are formally accepted for publication.
6. The most successful scientists continue to stay on top of requests and respond to critiques long after their papers are published.

### A few semi-related thoughts...

- I thought this was a compelling summary: [Open Access vs. Traditional Academic Journals Pros and Cons](https://eikipub.com/index.php/learning-resources/open-access-vs-traditional-academic-journals-pros-and-cons)
- I have never been able to convince my fellow authors to submit a preprint, so much so that I've stopped trying to do so.
- One of my most important research collaborations began as a result of some Powerpoint slides I built for myself to keep some ideas straight that I put online with no expectation that anyone else would use them.
- In graduate school, I thought reading papers was one of the main components of my planned career, but that hasn't been the case for many years, despite my regularly serving as an editor for journals and my own moderately substantial publication record.
- Helping people to turn ideas into papers and grants is a major part of my job, though.
- As an associate editor, it is far more difficult in 2025 to find people willing to review articles than it was in 2005.
