Hulu, Apple TV, Amazon | 75 | 2013-2018 | TV-MA | Period Drama, Political Thriller | At the height of the Cold War, married KGB spies pose as Americans in Washington, D.C.

1. I love [The Americans](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2149175) because the show is based on real historical events. The show is so well paced and directed, highly recommended to those looking for a TV series that is both thrilling, but also touches on some common themes that one can relate to (e.g. like having a dysfunctional family and the process that comes from healing those relationships).

### Arcane (mentioned by 4 students) [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11126994/)

Stream? | Episodes | Years | Rating | IMDB Genres | IMDB Description
:---------: | :--: | :-------: | :-------: | :----------------: | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Netflix | 18 | 2021-2024 | TV-14 | Action Epic, Adult Animation | Amid the stark discord of twin cities Piltover and Zaun, two sisters fight on rival sides of a war between magic technologies an7d clashing convictions.

1. I thought the characters in [Arcane](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11126994/) were complex and interesting, the world-building was good, and the animation was very well done.
2. The French animation studio Fortiche has done an INCREDIBLE job on [Arcane](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11126994/). The Sound Design/Production is also well done, it builds the world, fleshes out the characters, and they created a ton of original songs for the show. Somehow they got artists like Sting and Strommae on board and that's no small feat.
3. [Arcane](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11126994/) is animated, and the artwork + music is outstanding. The plot is a dystopian political drama, with elements of fantasy. It centers community and family relationships with the main characters being sisters that are caught in the middle of the political wars.
4. Excellent character writing and world building in [Arcane](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11126994/), which is especially rare coming from something adapted from a video game IP.

### Better Call Saul [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3032476)

Stream? | Episodes | Years | Rating | IMDB Genres | IMDB Description
:---------: | :--: | :-------: | :-------: | :----------------: | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Netflix | 63 | 2015-2022 | TV-MA | Drug Crime, Epic | The trials and tribulations of criminal lawyer Jimmy McGill in the years leading up to and past his fateful run-in with Walter White and Jesse Pinkman.

1. A lot of people recommend [Breaking Bad](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0903747), which I also really enjoyed, but I loved [Better Call Saul](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3032476) even more. I really enjoyed the character development of Saul and others in the show and generally found it very gripping and hard not to watch the next episode. I would say there are some "slow" parts in the show but I did not find them that disinteresting that I wanted to stop watching.

### Boardwalk Empire [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0979432)

Stream? | Episodes | Years | Rating | IMDB Genres | IMDB Description

1. [Boardwalk Empire](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0979432) is about the prohibition era, and very well conducted. I love the Steve Buscemi role, and actually my nickname (that only one person uses) is "Nucki", as the name of the main character was Nucki Thompson.

### Buffy the Vampire Slayer [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118276)

Hulu | 145 | 1997-2003 | TV-14 | Supernatural Fantasy, Teen Drama | A young woman, destined to slay vampires, demons and other infernal creatures, deals with her life fighting evil, with the help of her friends.

1. I love the way [Buffy the Vampire Slayer](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118276) uses supernatural creatures to represent real-life struggles, and I love the ensemble cast. Some of my attachment to this series might be the nostalgia I feel when watching it — I started watching when it first aired, and I can’t think of a series that impacted me more when I was growing up. Others might enjoy it for its strong character development and genre-bending episodes.

### The Chosen [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118276)

1. I like [The Chosen](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118276) because it intends to portray the human aspect of Jesus's life. I believe others may enjoy it because it does not overly emphasize his Divine essence.

1. [Dark Matter](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt19231492) is mind-boggling sci-fi and talks about the parallel universe concept.  Anyone who loves Quantum physics will appreciate this series.

1. [Dune: Prophecy](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10466872) has many layered stories that explore human resilience, politics and power. It is set in a futuristic setting, where all "thinking machines" or technology as we know it, is banned but still used to secretly guide humanity.

1. I like [The Equalizer](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11242246) because it has a lot of action. I think others would like this show because it has a new "villain" in every episode, and each case gets solved in one episode.

### Friends [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108778)

Stream? | Episodes | Years | Rating | IMDB Genres | IMDB Description
:---------: | :--: | :-------: | :-------: | :----------------: | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. I recommend [Friends](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108778) because not only do I have fun watching it, but I also improve my listening and speaking skills as an international student.

### Fringe [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108778)

1. I love [Fringe](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108778) because of the incredible blend of science and imagination in the mysteries that unfold with each episode. The show’s central characters have amazing chemistry, both as a group and in their individual relationships, creating emotional connections that grow stronger and more familial with each season. If you’re a fan of The X-Files, you’ll likely enjoy Fringe—it has a similar vibe but is less serious and a lot more fun, making it an engaging and entertaining ride from start to finish.

### Futurama [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0149460/)

Stream? | Episodes | Years | Rating | IMDB Genres | IMDB Description
:---------: | :--: | :-------: | :-------: | :----------------: | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. [Futurama](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0149460/) is a good mixture of nerdy comedy.

Netflix | 154 | 2000-2007 | TV-PG | Coming-of-Age, Teen Drama | A dramedy centering around the relationship between a thirtysomething single mother and her teen daughter living in Stars Hollow, Connecticut.

1. A big portion of [Gilmore Girls](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0238784) being my favorite series is nostalgia since I grew up watching it every Tuesday night with my mom and sisters, but it’s a fun fast-paced comedy/drama that is filled with witty dialogue and pop culture references.

### The Good Place (mentioned by 2 students) [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4955642)

Stream? | Episodes | Years | Rating | IMDB Genres | IMDB Description

2. I like [The Good Place](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4955642) because it is a funny sitcom but also makes you think as it engages with deep questions like how to lead a meaningful life in an entertaining way

### Grace and Frankie [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3609352)

Stream? | Episodes | Years | Rating | IMDB Genres | IMDB Description

1. I like [Grace and Frankie](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3609352) because of the main characters' shared friendship and respective families, as well as the show's generally dry humor/sarcasm. Even though it's centered around a pair of women in their 70s, the humor and some of the life situations depicted could apply to most young adult to older adult generations.

### Grey's Anatomy (mentioned by 2 students) [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0413573)

Stream? | Episodes | Years | Rating | IMDB Genres | IMDB Description

:---------: | :--: | :-------: | :-------: | :----------------: | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Netflix | 10 | 2018 | TV-MA | Psychological Horror, Supernatural Horror

1. I like [The Haunting of Hill House](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6763664/) because it is a horror series that doesn't rely completely on jump scares; it has an interesting plot and a great attention to detail. Others who enjoy horror movies (or those who can tolerate horror if it has a good plot) would enjoy it!

1. [How I Met Your Mother](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0460649) is just a lighthearted show that invokes joy, nostalgia, sadness, laughter, etc.

Hulu | 305 | 2011- | TV-14 | Hidden Camera, Comedy | Q, Sal, Joe and Murr are real-life best friends who love challenging each other to the most outrageous dares and stunts ever caught on hidden camera.

1. The challenges and things the four friends in [Impractical Jokers](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2100976) do I find to be quite hilarious. I think others in the class that have not previously watched the show would enjoy the humor in it as well. 

### Inventing Anna [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2100976)

Stream? | Episodes | Years | Rating | IMDB Genres | IMDB Description
:---------: | :--: | :-------: | :-------: | :----------------: | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Netflix | 9 | 2022 | TV-MA | Docudrama, Drama | A journalist with a lot to prove investigates the case of Anna Delvey, the Instagram-legendary German heiress who stole the hearts of New York's social scene - and stole their money as well.

The story is told from the perspective of a journalist who uncovers new clues about the woman in each episode, making it a captivating thriller about financial crime and the social dynamics of "high society."

### Lost [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0411008)

Stream? | Episodes | Years | Rating | IMDB Genres | IMDB Description

Netflix | 121 | 2004-2010 | TV-14 | Adventure Epic, Psychological Drama | The survivors of a plane crash are forced to work together in order to survive on a seemingly deserted tropical island.

1. [Lost](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0411008) is the last great weekly serialized show that people could discuss around the water cooler between episodes. The gradual realization that the writers were mostly making it up as they were going along means you can largely just enjoy it as popcorn entertainment.

Stream? | Episodes | Years | Rating | IMDB Genres | IMDB Description
:---------: | :--: | :-------: | :-------: | :----------------: | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. I love [Love Island USA](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8819906) because it’s trash reality television and allows me to turn my brain off, while still being entertaining! A lot of us use our brains for work often so it’s nice to take a break when watching TV.

The series combines intriguing legal cases with a touch of humor, making it a timeless and entertaining show. I think others might enjoy it for its charm and the brilliance of Andy Griffith’s performance as the titular lawyer.

1. I love [Mindhunter](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5290382) because I really enjoy thrillers, this show is binge-worthy however it’s quite dark.

### The Mindy Project [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2211129)

Stream? | Episodes | Years | Rating | IMDB Genres | IMDB Description

1. [The Mindy Project](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2211129) is a hilarious and heartwarming romantic comedy centered around Dr. Mindy Lahiri’s life and career. The series showcases a strong, relatable, and flawed female lead navigating her personal and professional world and the witty humor and quirky characters make it an enjoyable watch. I believe others in the class might enjoy its mix of comedy, romance, and the charming, laugh-out-loud moments throughout.

### Modern Family (mentioned by 2 students) [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1442437)

Stream? | Episodes | Years | Rating | IMDB Genres | IMDB Description

Hulu | 250 | 2009-2020 | TV-PG | Mockumentary, Sitcom | Three different, but related, families face trials and tribulations in their own uniquely comedic ways.

1. The reason I like [Modern Family](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1442437) is you do not really have to follow along and watch every episode in order to understand it. Others in the class that do not stay up to date on shows might also enjoy it.
2. I like [Modern Family](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1442437) because it's humorous and can teach you how to get along with family members.

### NCIS [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0364845)

Stream? | Episodes | Years | Rating | IMDB Genres | IMDB Description
:---------: | :--: | :-------: | :-------: | :----------------: | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. [NCIS](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0364845) is a crime solving show, most of the murder victims are military personnel. It's funny and carries a bunch of different plot lines throughout the seasons. I don’t recommend anything after 2020, but the first 14 seasons are pretty good.

1. I don't normally like medical shows but [Northern Exposure](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098878) highlights and humanizes the limits of modern medicine (it's from the 90's) across different cultures/populations. It's a fish-out-of water story about a NY physician working in rural Alaska.

### Parks and Recreation [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1266020)

Stream? | Episodes | Years | Rating | IMDB Genres | IMDB Description
:---------: | :--: | :-------: | :-------: | :----------------: | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Peacock | 124 | 2009-2015 | TV-14 | Mockumentary, Satire | The absurd antics of an Indiana town's public officials as they pursue sundry projects to make their city a better place.

1. [Parks and Recreation](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1266020) has always been my go to show when I need something to distract me. I find that it is funny in a good-hearted way unlike some other sitcoms that can lean into second hand embarrassment.

1. I love [The Queen's Gambit](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10048342/) because I think it's a great balance between thought-provoking and dramatic. I also love that it takes place in the 50s-60s, since the outfits and sets are really interesting.

Netflix | 76 | 2018- | TV-14 | Beauty Makeover, Home Improvement | A new Fab Five set out to Atlanta to help some of the city's people refine their wardrobes, grooming, diet, cultural pursuits, and home décor.

1. [Queer Eye](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7259746) centers around kindness, inclusivity, and helping others to live their best lives. I find the show to be very uplifting and a welcome reprieve from the pervasive misery in the modern news cycle.

1. [River Monsters](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1476750) appeals to a sense of wonder and adventure, as many of the "legendary" fish he aims to catch have myths associated with them. Then, when he inevitably captures the fish, the show ties together fact and fiction in a fun and informative way.
