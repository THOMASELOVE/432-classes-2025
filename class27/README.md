## Agenda

- Building and Assessing Statistical Work in 2025
- Maintaining and Enhancing What You've Learned

## Announcements

1. If you want me to review the grade on any Lab this semester, fill out the (optional) [Lab Regrade Request form](https://bit.ly/432-2025-lab-regrades) by Friday 2025-04-25 at noon.
    - See [Section 8.5 of our Syllabus](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-syllabus-2025/08-grading.html) for more on this.
2. [Quiz 2](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-2025/quiz2.html) is due Monday 2025-04-28 at 9 AM. The [Google Form](https://bit.ly/432-2025-quiz2-form) will close at 9:30 AM on Monday and will not re-open, so do not wait until the last minute.
    - I will address any Quiz 2 questions you have at the end of today's class.
    - I remind you all to look at [the Quiz 2 page](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-2025/quiz2.html) for details on revisions to the PDF file since its initial posting.
3. The [Project B portfolio](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-2025/projB.html#the-project-portfolio) is due to Canvas on Wednesday 2025-04-30 at Noon.
    - A complete submission includes four things: (1) your .qmd file, (2) the resulting .html file, (3) the slides **exactly as you used them in your presentation** if you used slides in your presentation, and (4) your R data set.
    - Those of you using data that cannot be shared with me be sure to submit [what I've asked for in the instructions](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-2025/projB.html#submitting-your-data).
    - If you are working with a partner, one of you supplies the portfolio and the other submits a one-page note to Canvas indicating the members of the partnership and that the partner will submit the work.
4. Bonus A on Campuswire is also due at noon on Wednesday 2025-04-30.
5. After you have completed the **CWRU course evaluation** at <https://webapps.case.edu/courseevals/>, which you can do at any time now, please email me to let me know, and if I receive such an email (please use the subject line **432 course evaluation done**) from you, I will stop pestering you to do it.

## Two Great Courses

- Frank Harrell's Short Course on Regression Modeling Strategies <https://hbiostat.org/doc/rms/4day.html> given annually (costs money) and his [book on the same subject](https://hbiostat.org/doc/rms/book/) (available online).
- Richard McIlreath's Statistical Rethinking course <https://github.com/rmcelreath/stat_rethinking_2024> with lectures (from 2023) posted to  YouTube. Bayesian ways of thinking are a main focus here.

I have recommended multiple other things on [our Sources page](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-sources).

## When will the 431 and 432 materials disappear from the web?

I don't promise that they will be there after June 1, 2025, but they will stay up until then.

    - [Glossary of Statistical Terms (from Frank Harrell)](https://hbiostat.org/glossary/)

In addition to these materials, the main topics today come from:

- [A CHecklist for statistical Assessment of Medical Papers (the CHAMP statement): explanation and elaboration](https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/55/18/1009.2)
- [Biostatistical Modeling Plan](https://www.fharrell.com/post/modplan) from Frank Harrell.
