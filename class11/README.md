## Announcements

1. On 2025-02-17, I revised the [Slides from Class 10](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-slides-2025/slides10.html) to resolve an issue I'd created by changing the random seeds between creating the slides and publishing them. Most of the slides with text explaining the models have revised coefficients as a result.
    - Don't forget about [the outline](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-classes-2025/blob/main/class10/outline.md) for the slides from Class 10.
    - The only material change from the initially published version is to the `fit3` model (where I switched a variable in, and left one out.)
    - However, many of the text explanations referred to my original results (before I switched random seeds) so I had to correct all of those explanations. This issue (plus a couple of typos I caught) required me to make changes to the text in the following slides: 33, 34, 39-40, 42, 46-48, 55-59, 84-85, 90, 94, 98, 102, 107, 192-193, 199, 218, 220 and 246-250, so you definitely want [the latest version](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-slides-2025/slides10.html).
    - In slide 59 of the **correct** version, you will see a graph where the x axis runs from 8-11 and the red and blue lines cross between values of x at 10 and 11.
2. Most of the necessary Project A Plan Revisions are in my hands, and I am reviewing them.
3. Once again, Frank Harrell's [Regression Modeling Strategies](https://hbiostat.org/rmsc/) and [Biostatistics for Biomedical Research](https://hbiostat.org/bbr/) books are incredibly useful resources for more on the `rms` and `Hmisc` packages.
