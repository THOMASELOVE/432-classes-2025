03 | 2025-01-21 | **[Slides 03](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-slides-2025/slides03.html)** | **[Word 03](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-slides-2025/slides03w.docx)** | **[Code 03](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-slides-2025/blob/main/slides03.qmd)** | Visit [Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu/), select **Zoom** and **Cloud Recordings**

- The HTML link provides the (RevealJS) version of the slides that I suggest you focus on during class.
- The Word link will let you download the material in the slides as a Word (.docx) document.
    - Some people prefer this to the HTML version for live note-taking.
- The Quarto file link provides the code I used (in [Quarto](https://quarto.org/)) to build the slides. Hit the download button after clicking the link above if you want the `.qmd` file.
- To print RevealJS slides **to pdf**, [follow these instructions](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/presenting.html#print-to-pdf) using Google Chrome as your browser.
- We attempt to record **every** 432 class via Zoom and post the recording to Canvas, but there have occasionally been problems in the past.

## Announcements

1. The problem with CRAN backlog are settled, and if you update the `performance` package to version 0.13.0 (as well as [any other updates](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-2025/software.html#updating-your-r-packages) for the packages you're using in R), you shouldn't have a problem using `check_model()` or other tools we've demonstrated.
     - If you want to see what the Lab 1 Question 2 (model 1) `check_model()` result should look like, here's [an image of it](check_models_lab1.png), but you should now be able to generate this on your own.
2. I tweaked the instructions for [Lab 2](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-2025/lab2.html) on 2025-01-17 and [Lab 3](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-2025/lab3.html) on 2025-01-20 and [Lab 4](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-2025/lab4.html) today (2025-01-21), so make sure you look at the current versions as you plan your work on those assignments.
3. The most obvious options for real-time project collaboration seem to be [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) and Posit Cloud. Since Google Colab is free, I feel more comfortable recommending it, at least for this semester.
4. I am compiling a list of errors in the current version of the [432 Class Notes](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-notes/), and you can find that list now by clicking on Notes on [the top bar of our website](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-2025/), or [at this link](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-2025/notes.html).
    - If you find any errors in the 432 notes, please submit them to [Campuswire](https://campuswire.com/) in the "Notes edits" folder. I'd really appreciate it.
    - The [431 course notes from Fall 2024](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-book/) are available at <https://thomaselove.github.io/431-book/>. If you find errors there, I'm very interested in hearing about them, too.

## Reminders

1. [Lab 1](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-2025/lab1.html)  is due tomorrow at noon to Canvas. Make sure you are looking at the version of the instructions posted 2025-01-15, which includes a pair of tips.
    - [TA office hours](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-2025/calendar.html#ta-office-hours) continue later today, and [Campuswire](https://campuswire.com/) remains available 24/7 for help.
    - The next substantial assignment is [Lab 2](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-2025/lab2.html), due 2025-01-29.
2. Thanks to those of you who have carefully read [the Syllabus](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-syllabus-2025/). For those of you that haven't finished that task yet, I encourage you to do so before Thursday 2025-01-23 at 9 AM.
3. Please continue reading [How to be a modern scientist](https://leanpub.com/modernscientist) so that you finish that by the end of January.
4. My intention is to discuss [Project A](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-2025/projA.html) in some detail in class 5 (one week from today) but I'm happy to address questions about it (especially via [Campuswire](https://campuswire.com/)) at any time.

## One Last Thing

from [Flowing Data](https://flowingdata.com/2025/01/21/where-you-would-feel-richer-and-poorer/), "Bloomberg has an interactive by Claire Ballentine and Charlie Wells that lets you compare how income in one metro area would feel like in another due to differences in cost of living."
