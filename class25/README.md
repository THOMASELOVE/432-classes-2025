3. Quiz 2 is due at noon Friday 2025-04-25.

6. The Course Evaluation at <https://webapps.case.edu/courseevals/> should be done anytime after you *present* your project, and is due when CWRU tells you it is, usually in early May. Please do fill this out. It delights me every year when we get 100% participation.
