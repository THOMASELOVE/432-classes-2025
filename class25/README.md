## Agenda and Announcements

This session is primarily an Ask Me Anything about Project B, and will be held via Zoom only. Sorry - **I have no slides for you today**.

1. There is a [Minute Paper after Class 25](https://bit.ly/432-2025-minute-25) available at <https://bit.ly/432-2025-minute-25>, due at noon Wednesday 2025-04-16.
2. Sorry that the recording didn't happen for Class 24 - couldn't be helped. You have the slides, if you missed the session. I intend to record the remaining classes this week and next Thursday.
3. Lab 7 Comments and Grades are available now in our Course Grading Roster.
    - We awarded up to 5 bonus points for on-time submission, and if you avoided certain problems.
    - If you didn't get the table of contents right, or didn't load your packages correctly, or your HTML wasn't knitted properly, you lost some credit on Lab 7. You'll lose more credit in your Project B portfolio if these things aren't done properly. Also, you **do** need a session information call at the end of the portfolio.
    - Those of you who scored 50 or above including the bonus should see a score of 50 on Lab 7.
    - While you are welcome to continue to use R 4.4.2 through the semester (including for Project B), we encourage you to upgrade to 4.4.3 when you can.
4. There is a Bonus Opportunity up on Campuswire. Thanks to those of you who've already responded. If you haven't, you should.
5. By Thursday's class time, you should have a document in your email from me describing your grades on everything so far, so you can check my records, since you have more invested in this than I do at this stage.
6. Quiz 2 will be posted for you on Friday. I have decided to give you an extra three days (thus, TWO weekends) to complete it, not because it's harder or should take longer, but because I think it will reduce worry. The new deadline for Quiz 2 submission is **9 AM on Monday 2025-04-28**.
    - The Quiz covers materials discussed in Classes 1-23 of 432, although everything we discuss today is certainly relevant.
    - On Thursday, I should be able to provide you with more detailed instructions, in case you want to read them in advance.

## With regard to Project B, a few thoughts:

1. If you are building a time-to-event model and discover a problem with proportional hazards, noticing the problem is the requirement for 432 Project B, not solving it.
2. Your Analysis 1 must be associated with Research Question 1, and must be about a model for a multi-categorical outcome, a count outcome, or a survival (time-to-event with censoring) outcome. No other options are available for Analysis 1.
3. Your Analysis 2 could (in addition to the options in Analysis 1) also be a linear model or a (binary) logistic model.
4. It's not a good idea to try to present unfinished work during the presentation, as you should be asking questions now if you have them. It is OK to ask questions of me during the presentation - in fact, I hope you will.
5. The presentation sessions are meant to be 20 minutes long, with 5 minutes wiggle room for longer conversations if needed. This means that if no one asked you any questions, you should be able to complete your presentation in 15 minutes. I will stop you and make you answer questions, though.
6. Most people who do very, very well on the presentation prepare slides for the presentation, **and also** have the complete portfolio available to be pulled up to answer questions about things not in the slides. Some people choose just to present from the portfolio, which is also fine, and sometimes works very well.
7. I expect your presentation to enable me to answer [all 8 questions about your Project B work in general](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-2025/projB.html#questions-about-your-project-b-work-in-general) after experiencing it.
8. I expect your presentation of your analyses to touch on **both** of your two research questions, although you might emphasize one more than the other (that's up to you.) Be sure you tell me: (see [this link](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-2025/projB.html#the-presentation))
    - What your research questions are and why they are important.
    - What data you used and why it was relevant to addressing your questions.
        - You should present at least two effective visualizations of your data that help Professor Love understand what can be said about your research questions, at least one of which should help Professor Love explore your data, and at least one of which should help Professor Love evaluate the success of a particular model. Build the presentation around the figures!
    - What statistical methods you used to analyze and model the data and why they were appropriate.
        - In particular, you are required to present at least one result that is derived from one of your regression models. Aim to present something derived from **each of** your two analyses.
    - What the results say about your research questions - what you have learned by doing this project?
9. I expect you to be able to answer all 8 questions for each of the two types of models you have fit, including...
    - [these 8 about time-to-event models](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-2025/projB.html#questions-about-a-model-for-a-time-to-event-outcome-with-censoring)
    - [these 8 about count outcome models](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-2025/projB.html#questions-about-a-model-for-a-count-outcome)
    - [these 8 about multi-categorical outcome models](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-2025/projB.html#questions-about-a-model-for-a-multi-categorical-outcome-with-3-7-levels)
    - [these 8 about a quantitative outcome (linear) model](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-2025/projB.html#questions-about-a-model-for-a-quantitative-outcome)
    - [these 8 about a binary outcome (logistic) model](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-2025/projB.html#questions-about-a-model-for-a-binary-outcome)
10. If you are working with a partner, I will decide who speaks for the first half of the presentation on the spot, at random.

## What's Coming Up

- There is a [Minute Paper after Class 25](https://bit.ly/432-2025-minute-25) available at <https://bit.ly/432-2025-minute-25>, due at noon Wednesday 2025-04-16.
- Thursday 2025-04-17: in-person class introducing Hierarchical Models, followed by four in-person Project B Presentations for those [listed on the Schedule](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-classes-2025/tree/main/projectB). I know that some folks will be unable to attend class because of the Public Health event downtown.
- Friday 2025-04-18: Zoom Project B presentations for four groups, as listed on [the Schedule](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-classes-2025/tree/main/projectB), and you will receive Quiz 2 at noon.

## After This Week

1. Project B presentations over Zoom on Monday 2025-04-21, Tuesday 2025-04-22 and Wednesday 2025-04-23, [as scheduled](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-classes-2025/tree/main/projectB).
2. No class on Tuesday 2025-04-22. We do have our final class of the semester (all new material) on Thursday 2025-04-24.
3. Quiz 2 is due at noon Friday 2025-04-25.
4. The (optional) [Lab Regrade Request form](https://bit.ly/432-2025-lab-regrades) is also due on 2025-04-25 (same day as Quiz 2). See [Section 8.5 of our Syllabus](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-syllabus-2025/08-grading.html) for more on this.
5. [Project B portfolio](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-2025/projB.html#the-project-portfolio) is due for everyone, submitting to Canvas, by noon on Wednesday 2025-04-30.
6. The Course Evaluation at <https://webapps.case.edu/courseevals/> should be done anytime after you *present* your project, and is due when CWRU tells you it is, usually in early May. Please do fill this out. It delights me every year when we get 100% participation.

## One Last Thing

The concert went nicely. Thanks to a few folks for coming.
