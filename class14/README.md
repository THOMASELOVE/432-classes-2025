## Annnouncements

1. The Answer Sketch for Lab 5 will be posted to our Shared Drive by class time.
2. A reminder that a reasonably complete presentation of code for linear regression (Section 3) and logistic regression (Section 4) is found in the **support1000** example which has been posted to our Shared Drive.
3. One of the two open opportunities for bonus credit on Campuswire will close down (to new submissions that receive bonus credit) tomorrow.
4. The [course calendar](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-2025/calendar.html) is now up to date, including everything you need to know about the rest of the semester's plans.

## On Statistical Significance and P-values

These are the two main articles on the subject that I ask people to read (or at least skim) in my courses.

- [Statistical Inference in the 21st Century: A World Beyond *p* < 0.05](https://amstat.tandfonline.com/toc/utas20/73/sup1) from 2019 in *The American Statistician*
- The American Statistical Association's 2016 [Statement on p-Values](http://amstat.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00031305.2016.1154108): Context, Process and Purpose.

## Today in "How To Be A Modern Scientist"

### On Scientific Talks

- Entertain, don't teach
- Know your audience (goals shift depending on audience)
- Always lead with a brief, understandable to everyone statement of the problem
- Then explain the data and measurement tools before you explain your variables
- Then explain the variables before you explain the model
- When presenting results, tell a story
- Put your talk online

### On Reading Scientific Papers

- How much should you read?
- Importance of the figures and the introduction and conclusion
- Explain an interesting paper to someone else
- Find out if others have read it

## Today's Excerpt from "[Moving to a World Beyond 'p < 0.05'](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-sources/blob/main/pdf/ASA_2019_A_World_Beyond.pdf)"

from **Don't say "Statistically Significant"**

The [ASA Statement on P-Values and Statistical Significance (2016)](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-sources/blob/main/pdf/ASA_2016_Pvalues_Context_Process_Purpose.pdf) stopped just short of recommending that declarations of "statistical significance" be abandoned. We take that step here.

We conclude, based on our review of the articles in this special issue and the broader literature, that it is time to stop using the term  "statistically significant" entirely. Nor should variants such as "significantly different," "p < 0.05," and "nonsignificant" survive, whether expressed in words, by asterisks in a table, or in some other way.

Regardless of whether it was ever useful, a declaration of "statistical significance" has today become meaningless.

## Quiz 1 

- [The Quiz 1 Links page](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-2025/quiz1.html) will provide:
    - A link to a PDF file containing complete instructions and all of the questions,
    - A link to the Google Form Answer Sheet where you will answer the questions, and
    - Links to download the Data Sets I am providing for you
- Quiz 1 is due Wednesday 2025-03-05 at noon.
    - You can obtain help during the Quiz period by (1) emailing Dr. Love or (2) asking him questions during Class 15, on Tuesday 2025-03-04 from 1 to 2:15 PM. We will not answer questions about Quiz 1 posed in any other way, and that includes Campuswire.
    - If we need to make changes or add hints related to Quiz 1 after it is initially made available to you, Dr. Love will email that information to you and it will also be posted to [the Quiz 1 Links page](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-2025/quiz1.html).
