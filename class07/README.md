## Announcements

1. I am sorry about the recent removal of many important data sets from federal sites.
    - My fury about this and many other actions of this administration is substantial, but I'll spare you that.
    - Those of you who are scared (which I assume is all of you) about what the current presidential administration is doing, or the direction of the world in general, I understand and empathize.
    - I encourage you not to miss opportunities to take meaningful action in your life and career, and spare some time to comfort others instead of being overwhelmed by worry when no one really knows yet how any of this will shake out.
    - Like it or not, we live in very interesting times. Good luck to all of you.
    - Here is an [archive of all CDC data sets updated before 2025-01-28](https://archive.org/details/20250128-cdc-datasets). You may find it easier to work with this [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1lk5DrQMKIKgZFBoT_ZYWOCkt7In87IG_) if you're focused on BRFSS data, in particular. (Thanks, Rebecca Stinson!)
2. In Project A, if your linear regression outcome has at least 400 observed (i.e. non-missing) values, and if your logistic regression outcome has at least 200 observed values in the group you're calling "1" and 200 more in the group you're calling "0", then I'm not going to be meaningfully concerned about your sample size.
    - If your outcomes don't meet these standards, I **might** be meaningfully concerned about your sample size, but I might not.
3. The Project A plan is due at noon Wednesday 2025-02-05 to [Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu/). Please make that deadline.

## Today's Thoughts from "How To Be A Modern Scientist"

- <https://www.overleaf.com/gallery/tagged/cv> has an array of attractive CV templates, and I have used a free account at [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) to maintain my CV and other items for years.
- Dr. Sherri Rose's thoughts on [Academic CVs for Statistical Science Faculty Positions](https://drsherrirose.org/academic-cvs-for-statistical-science-faculty-positions)
- Each of my courses (431, 432 and 500) are designed in large part: (a) to teach you a wide range of technical skills (both about statistical thinking and coding in R) and (b) to dump as much of the practical experience I have into your head as quickly as I can.

### On Paper Writing...

See [Campuswire](https://campuswire.com/) for an opportunity to provide feedback related to these quotes.

1. Write clearly and simply even though it may make your papers harder to publish.
2. No one will care about your grades in graduate school but everyone will care what you produced.
3. It is important to publish results that aren't surprising or novel.
4. The first thing to do in writing a paper is not to write, but instead to create a set of 1-4 publication quality plots, and show them to someone to make sure they "get" your story before proceeding.
5. An important thing to work on in graduate school is your own internal times that tells you "OK, we have done enough, time to write this up."

## One Last Thing

We rescued another cat this weekend. Her name is Rosie, short for [Rose Maybud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruddigore). We hope she and Josie will eventually become friends, but it will take a while.
