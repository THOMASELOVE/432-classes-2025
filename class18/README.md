3. You might be interested in the [Data Rescue Project](https://www.datarescueproject.org/).
    - "Our goal is to serve as a clearinghouse for data rescue-related efforts and data access points for public US governmental data that are currently at risk. We want to know what is happening in the community so that we can coordinate focus. Efforts include: data gathering, data curation and cleaning, data cataloging, and providing sustained access and distribution of data assets."

## Today's Topics

1. What happens if we fit a linear model to a count outcome? (This and items 2-3 also build on the medicare data from Class 15.)
2. How do I think about selecting non-linear terms in light of Spearman $\rho^2$? 
3. How do we fit a Poisson regression with the `rms` package, and do we then get everything we get with `ols()` and `lrm()`?
