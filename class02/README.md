02 | 2025-01-16 | **[Slides 02](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-slides-2025/slides02.html)** | **[Word 02](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-slides-2025/slides02w.docx)** | **[Code 02](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-slides-2025/blob/main/slides02.qmd)** | Visit [Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu/), select **Zoom** and **Cloud Recordings**

- The HTML link provides the (RevealJS) version of the slides that I suggest you focus on during class.
- The Word link will let you download the material in the slides as a Word (.docx) document.
    - Some people prefer this to the HTML version for live note-taking.
- The Quarto file link provides the code I used (in [Quarto](https://quarto.org/)) to build the slides. Hit the download button after clicking the link above if you want the `.qmd` file.
- To print RevealJS slides **to pdf**, [follow these instructions](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/presenting.html#print-to-pdf) using Google Chrome as your browser.
- We attempt to record **every** 432 class via Zoom and post the recording to Canvas, but there have occasionally been problems in the past.

## Announcements

1. For [Lab 1](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-2025/lab1.html), in question 1b, I meant to list 15 candidate variables, but accidentally listed `unins` twice, and left out `unemp`. I've now fixed that to corrrectly list both `unins` and `unemp` as candidates. I've also added a couple of **tips** to the [instructions](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-2025/lab1.html) that may be helpful.
2. Results of the little pair of polls on [Campuswire](https://campuswire.com/), where I asked "About how many times have you opened R Studio in 2025?"
 
Not at all (that's OK) | 1 to 3 times | More than 3 times | Responses
:--------------------: | :--------------------: | :--------------------: | :--------:
12 (37.5%) | 9 (28.1%) | 11 (34.4%) | 32

3. Some Results from the Welcome to 432 Survey are [posted to our Shared Drive](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mpLfZoKDNFJ79hdOyNnpiEs6OxDL-0DWFAf-gUjnJwo/edit?usp=drive_link).
