## Agenda

- Building and Assessing Statistical Work in 2025
- Maintaining and Enhancing What You've Learned
- Your Questions, My Answers on Quiz 2, Project B and anything else...

## Project B Presentations

- All of the presentations are done. Thank you for your effort and for being on time for your presentations and being well-prepared, which let me get through this with a minimum of pain. I really appreciate it.
- The range of presentation grades was **71** to **97**.
- You should have an email from me with my comments on your presentation.
    - The scale for the "Rate these concerns" questions was Excellent/Good/Acceptable/Needs Improvement.
    - The scale for the items that followed those questions was Yes/Somewhat/No, although sometimes I used a different phrase (like "Not Quite" or "Mostly") to indicate "Somewhat".
- Several of the presentations were outstanding, and I have shared some of those slides from those presentations with you on our Shared Drive in the **Some Sample Project B Slides** folder.
    - Note that I have deleted the recordings for all of the Project B presentations.
- My method for calculating your eventual Project B grade is found in the **How Will I estimate your grade in 432? (Spring 2025)** document on our Shared Google Drive.

## Announcements

1. TA office hours have ended for the semester. Many thanks to the TAs for their exceptional efforts. [Campuswire](https://campuswire.com/) will remain open until noon on Wednesday 2025-04-30.
2. If you want me to review the grade on any Lab this semester, fill out the (optional) [Lab Regrade Request form](https://bit.ly/432-2025-lab-regrades) by Friday 2025-04-25 at noon.
    - See [Section 8.5 of our Syllabus](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-syllabus-2025/08-grading.html) for more on this.
3. [R version 4.5.0](https://cran.case.edu/) is now available! The current production version of RStudio is `2024.12.1+563` released `2025-02-13`.
4. [Quiz 2](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-2025/quiz2.html) is due Monday 2025-04-28 at 9 AM. The [Google Form](https://bit.ly/432-2025-quiz2-form) will close at 9:30 AM on Monday and will not re-open, so do not wait until the last minute.
    - I will address any Quiz 2 questions you have at the end of today's class.
    - I remind you all to look at [the Quiz 2 page](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-2025/quiz2.html) for details on revisions to the PDF file since its initial posting.
    - Here are three hints for the Quiz:
        - In **Question 9**, if one of the indicator variables for a multi-categorical predictor is included in the "best subsets" result, include the entire multi-categorical predictor in the model you select.
        - A correct answer to **Question 10** includes the data from subject `H012304`, who is in the 172nd row of the `data3` tibble.
        - In **Question 12**, I will be looking to see that you accurately describe the meaning of both the point estimate and the 99% confidence interval. As noted, an excellent answer will show that you've reviewed the description of the variables contained in `data4`.
5. The [Project B portfolio](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-2025/projB.html#the-project-portfolio) is due to Canvas on Wednesday 2025-04-30 at Noon.
    - A complete portfolio submission includes four things: (1) your .qmd file, (2) the resulting .html file, (3) the slides **exactly as you used them in your presentation** (most people used slides, a few will send their presented .html), and (4) your R data set.
    - Those of you using data that cannot be shared with me be sure to submit [what I've asked for in the instructions](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-2025/projB.html#submitting-your-data).
    - If you are working with a partner, one of you supplies the portfolio and the other submits a one-page note to Canvas indicating the members of the partnership and that the partner will submit the work.
    - I have a list of five things I plan to review in each portfolio, since I won't have time to read every part of every portfolio (38 portfolios in a day is more than I can read.) I will read the whole portfolio for anyone on the boundary of an A/B in the class, of course.
        - You can probably guess that two of the five things I will look at are: loading packages properly, and the conclusions/discussion section. I won't specify the other three.
6. Bonus A on [Campuswire](https://campuswire.com/) is also due at noon on Wednesday 2025-04-30. I've reminded you enough on this, I think.
7. After you have completed the **CWRU course evaluation** at <https://webapps.case.edu/courseevals/>, which you can do at any time now, please email me to let me know, and if I receive such an email (please use the subject line **432 course evaluation done**) from you, I will stop pestering you to do it. I had 6 responses as of 2025-04-23 at 12:25 PM.

## Four Interesting post-432 Learning Pathways

1. Frank Harrell's Short Course on Regression Modeling Strategies <https://hbiostat.org/doc/rms/4day.html> given annually (costs money) and his [book on the same subject](https://hbiostat.org/doc/rms/book/) (available online).
2. Richard McIlreath's Statistical Rethinking course <https://github.com/rmcelreath/stat_rethinking_2024> with lectures (from 2023) posted to  YouTube. Bayesian ways of thinking are a major focus here.
3. [Get Started with Tidymodels](https://www.tidymodels.org/start/) is a great place to start learning about tidymodels. The book is [Tidy Modeling with R](https://www.tmwr.org/) by Max Kuhn and Julia Silge.
4. Generalized Additive Models (gams) in R: See [Noam Ross' online (free) short course](https://noamross.github.io/gams-in-r-course/) and Michael Clark's [Generalized Additive Models](https://m-clark.github.io/generalized-additive-models/) and the [gratia package](https://github.com/gavinsimpson/gratia) which provides `ggplot`-based graphics and utility functions for working with generalized additive models (GAMs) fitted using the `mgcv` package.

I have recommended multiple other things on [our Sources page](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-sources).

## When will the 431 and 432 materials disappear from the web?

I don't promise that they will be there after June 1, 2025, but they will stay up until then.
