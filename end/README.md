# End-of-Semester Notes Regarding 432 For Spring 2025

## Remaining Course Deliverables

See the list on [the Class 27 README](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-classes-2025/tree/main/class27).

- After you have completed the **CWRU course evaluation** at <https://webapps.case.edu/courseevals/>, which you can do at any time now, please email me to let me know, and if I receive such an email (please use the subject line **432 course evaluation done**) from you, I will stop pestering you to do it.

## Getting Help

- [Campuswire](https://campuswire.com/) closes at noon on Wednesday 2025-04-30.

## After the Projects are Submitted

1. I will post **432 course grades** to SIS on Thursday 2025-05-01. I don't know when you'll be able to see them, but I assume you'll see them on Friday morning.
2. The **Course Notes** and other materials from 431 and 432 that are available now (including the recordings) will remain where they are until **2025-06-01** at which point some or all of them will disappear, and you would have to email me to get access, if I even still have it. So deal with this in May, please, if you want something.
3. If you are interested in **serving as a TA for 431 and/or 432 next year**, we will have opportunities for both paid and volunteer positions. I will email you about this in the month of June. No need to get in touch with me before then to express interest, although you are welcome to do so.
