## Announcements

1. I will post a document containing feedback on the Minute Paper after Class 23 by class time.
2. One question I got from several people is, essentially, asking me to recommend courses. It's a reasonable question, but I don’t talk about courses other than my own in general terms. What you want to pursue individually is too important and I am NOT an expert in the offerings here at CWRU. Students currently taking those courses, and instructors teaching them, are the people you want to talk to. That said, I teach a course called PQHS 500 every Spring. Most of the people who take 432 and like it also like 500. It’s a course in observational studies, and its current syllabus is [online](https://thomaselove.github.io/500-syllabus-2025/). I plan to give a version of that course again in Spring 2026.
3. Here is a list of [CWRU mental health resources available to students](https://case.edu/wellness/campuswide-resources/mental-health-resources). 
4. The Lab 7 sketch and grading rubric will be posted shortly before class time to our Shared Google Drive.
5. Regarding Project B, I want to remind you that there is a [Quarto template for the Project B portfolio](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-data/blob/master/data/432_projectB_portfolio_template.qmd) on our 432-data page. It's not mandatory, but it has some real advantages in terms of organizing your work and making sure you don't leave anything important out.

## What Happens Next Week?

- Tuesday 2025-04-15: Class 25 is a Zoom class, with listed topic **Project B - Ask Me Anything**. There are no slides posted yet for the class, but between now and Tuesday, I expect to add about 20-30 minutes worth of new-ish material including some tips for the Quiz, as well as some re-iteration of good advice from the Project B instructions. So I expect the "new material" section of the class should be done at about 1:45 PM.
    - Tuesday is also the last day for you to complete Lab 6 if you haven't yet, or email me questions about your Project A grade.
    - We expect to get Lab 7 grades and feedback to you on Tuesday, as well.
- Wednesday 2025-04-16: There will be a Minute Paper after Class 25, which I will post on Tuesday. It will be due at noon Wednesday.
- Thursday 2025-04-17: in-person class introducing Hierarchical Models, followed by four in-person Project B Presentations for those [listed on the Schedule](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-classes-2025/tree/main/projectB). 
- Friday 2025-04-18: Zoom Project B presentations for four groups, as listed on [the Schedule](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-classes-2025/tree/main/projectB), and you will receive Quiz 2 at noon.

## After Next Week

1. Project B presentations over Zoom on Monday 2025-04-21, Tuesday 2025-04-22 and Wednesday 2025-04-23, [as scheduled](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-classes-2025/tree/main/projectB).
2. No class on Tuesday 2025-04-22. We do have our final class of the semester (all new material) on Thursday 2025-04-24.
3. Quiz 2 is due at noon Friday 2025-04-25.
4. The (optional) [Lab Regrade Request form](https://bit.ly/432-2025-lab-regrades) is also due on 2025-04-25 (same day as Quiz 2). See [Section 8.5 of our Syllabus](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-syllabus-2025/08-grading.html) for more on this.
5. [Project B portfolio](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-2025/projB.html#the-project-portfolio) is due for everyone, submitting to Canvas, by noon on Wednesday 2025-04-30.
6. The Course Evaluation at <https://webapps.case.edu/courseevals/> should be done anytime after you *present* your project, and is due when CWRU tells you it is, usually in early May. Please do fill this out. It delights me every year when we get 100% participation.
