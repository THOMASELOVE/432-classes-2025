## Today's Excerpt from "[Moving to a World Beyond 'p < 0.05'](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-sources/blob/main/pdf/ASA_2019_A_World_Beyond.pdf)"

from **Don't say "Statistically Significant"**

... And so the tool has become the tyrant. The problem is not simply use of the word "significant," although the statistical and ordinary language meanings of the word are indeed now hopelessly confused; the term should be avoided for that reason alone. 

The problem is a larger one, however: using bright-line rules for justifying scientific claims or conclusions can lead to erroneous beliefs and poor decision making ([ASA 2016 statement](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-sources/blob/main/pdf/ASA_2016_Pvalues_Context_Process_Purpose.pdf), Principle 3). 

A label of statistical significance adds nothing to what is already conveyed by the value of p; in fact, this dichotomization of p-values makes matters worse.

For example, no p-value can reveal the plausibility, presence, truth, or importance of an association or effect. Therefore, a label of statistical significance does not mean or imply that an association or effect is highly probable, real, true, or important. Nor does a label of statistical nonsignificance lead to the association or effect being improbable, absent, false, or unimportant.

Yet the dichotomization into "significant" and "not significant" is taken as an imprimatur of authority on these characteristics....

As Gelman and Stern (2006) famously observed, the difference between "significant" and "not significant" is not itself statistically significant.
