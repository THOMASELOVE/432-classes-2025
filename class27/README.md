## Agenda and Announcements

- Building and Assessing Statistical Work in 2025
- Maintaining and Enhancing What You've Learned


## Two Great Courses

- Frank Harrell's Short Course on Regression Modeling Strategies <https://hbiostat.org/doc/rms/4day.html> given annually (costs money) and his [book on the same subject](https://hbiostat.org/doc/rms/book/) (available online).
- Richard McIlreath's Statistical Rethinking course <https://github.com/rmcelreath/stat_rethinking_2024> with lectures (from 2023) posted to  YouTube. Bayesian ways of thinking are a main focus here.

I have recommended multiple other things on [our Sources page](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-sources).

## When will the 431 and 432 materials disappear from the web?

I don't promise that they will be there after June 1, 2025, but they will stay up until then.

- The two references in the final image are dead links. Instead, use these:
    - [Statistical Problems to Document and To Avoid](https://discourse.datamethods.org/t/author-checklist/3407)
    - [Glossary of Statistical Terms (from Frank Harrell)](https://hbiostat.org/glossary/)

In addition to these materials, the main topics today come from:

- [A CHecklist for statistical Assessment of Medical Papers (the CHAMP statement): explanation and elaboration](https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/55/18/1009.2)
- [Biostatistical Modeling Plan](https://www.fharrell.com/post/modplan) from Frank Harrell.
